# Data structures
Typical task for the file is about a small (or a little bit bigger) investigation about certain theme. After researching the theme
we should have a discussion about it and you need to implement / solve a task. I will put theme and tasks and you need to pick them 
up and make pull request with solutions. Note that the task will be considered as done only after discussion with me.
## Linked list
You need to learn what linked list is. You can use sources like [that](https://humanwhocodes.com/blog/2019/01/computer-science-in-javascript-linked-list/)
### Task:
Implement a `LinkedList` class with operations `add(l)`, `remove(l)`, `get(l)`, `size()`. Try to be efficient and reasonable.
